/- Define Euclidean plane as normed vector space over ‚Ñù of dimension 2 -/

/- 1.1 Define points, and functions to get the x,y-coordinates -/

/- 1.2 Segments, rays, and lines -/

/- Define vectors in dimension 2 -/

/- Define unit vectors (for directions) -/

/- Define oriented segments, including "carrier" and endpoints, and directions (a unit vector).  Here we only allow nondegenerate oriented segements. Next, we define oriented segments_generalized (which only remebers the starting and end points), which allows the two points to be identified; and view oriented segments as an instance.  -/

/- Define the interior of an oriented segment -/



/- Define rays, including "carrier", endpoints, and directions. -/

/- Define lines to be affine subspaces of dimension 1, citing affine vector spaces. -/

/- Relations between these concepts -/




/- Archimedean properties: on a ray/line, one can always find a far away point, and on an oriented segment, one can always find a point in the interior. -/
