/- This file discuss the relative positions of points and lines on a plane. -/


/- Positions of a point relative to a ray: 1. at the end point, 2. on the ray (not including the end point) 3. on the opposite direction of the ray.  4. on the "left" of the ray. 5. on the "right" of the ray. -/

/- Also inlclude functions such as Is_on_the_ray, and a type Left_of_the_ray.   -/



/- Position of three (distinct) points.  Giving to colinear (futher classification) -/


/- Position of two rays -/




/- Position of two lines; need a function to take the intersection of two lines (when they intersect). -/


/- A lot more theorems regarding positions -/
