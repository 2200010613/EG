# Team Projects
This file describes the projects of each team.

## General Requirement

1. Each team should have a team leader. The team leader upload the finished project by creating a github pull request, with pull request name in the following format `Team_n_project_changed_xxx.lean_and_yyy.lean`, where n is your team number, xxx.lean is the file you edited.

2. Without a discussion with Jiang Jiedong, you should only fill in sorry's (or delete "by" if you want) and NOT change any other place. You are allowed to use theorems whose proof is still a sorry in your proof. If you discover errors in statements or have ideas on formulating new theorems, please feel free to contact Jiang Jiedong.

3. Please write you code in a clean and readable way. You are encouraged to read other files and immitating them. This will help very much in later stages. `If your proof can be simplified greatly, we may reject your pull request and ask you to rewrite it`. And please note that we will have more requirements on writing comments inline in future.
